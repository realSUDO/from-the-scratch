## **The README Philosophy**

> "So many people today focus on building the project..  
> even if they don't understand what is going on in the project..  
> they'll use AI generated code.. ,  
> they'll vibe code everything.. without getting the foundation.."

**This repo is different..!!** and when I say this.. **I MEAN IT**  
Here I build small (maybe big in future).. but **from the scratch** projects..

You can say *haha.. AI can build this in 5 mins..* and judge me on that  
but bro.. **I am no AI.. I am human and in a Learning stage..**

Infact I'm trying to learn how to write `.md` file `properly`.. yea u saw what I did there?
